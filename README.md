# Flight Price Prediction ‚úàÔ∏è
## Introduction

Planning a trip and wondering how much it'll cost to fly? Our flight price prediction model can help! By analyzing various factors like departure date, destination, airline, and more, we provide accurate estimates of flight prices.

## How it Works ü§ñ

- Data Collection: We gather historical flight data, including information about flight routes, dates, prices, and airlines.
- Feature Engineering: We extract relevant features from the data, such as travel time, day of the week, and seasonal factors.
- Model Training: We train machine learning models (e.g., regression models, random forests) to learn the relationship between these features and flight prices.
- Prediction: For a given flight, we input its features into the trained model to predict its price.
## Technologies Used üíª

- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library for regression models.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
